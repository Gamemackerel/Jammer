# Jammer

This webtoy will generate listenable music according to the evolution of a cellular automata which exists on a 2d hexagonal lattice. The lattice is topologically equivalent to the [Tonnetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonnetz), meaning that tonal space is encoded in the layout of the cells. Defining a ruleset is equivalent to composing a song.

Jammer is currently unfinished, but you can try out a stable version with most of the features [here](http://students.washington.edu/abemill/Jammer/).

This project is the next iteration of my previous musical CA webtoy: [MusicBox](https://github.com/Gamemackerel/Musicbox).
