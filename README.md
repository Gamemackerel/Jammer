# Jammer

This webtoy will generate listenable music according to the evolution of a cellular automata which exists on a 2d hexagonal lattice. The lattice is topologically equivalent to the [Tonnetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonnetz), meaning that tonal space is encoded in the layout of the cells. Defining a ruleset is equivalent to composing an infinite song.

This project is the next iteration of my previous CA webtoy and first real programming project: [MusicBox](https://github.com/Gamemackerel/Musicbox).
