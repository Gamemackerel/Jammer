This webtoy will generate listenable music according to the evolution of the cellular automata which exists on a 2d hexagonal lattice. The lattice is topologically equivalent to the [Tonnetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonnetz), meaning that tonal space is encoded in the layout of the cells, and meaning that defining a ruleset constitutes composing an infinite song.
